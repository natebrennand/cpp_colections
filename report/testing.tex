The test suite is composed of tests to check that we stop all errors at the compilation stage, not at runtime.
Files placed in the \code{tests/} directory will be compiled against \code{collections.h}.

Files with \code{fail\_} at the start of the filename will be expected to fail.

Those without will be expected to build.
Buildable files will also be executed.
They should include assertions to insure the library is executing as desired.
Passing tests should not include any output to stdout/stderr.


Executable with \code{make}:

\begin{lstlisting}
make test
\end{lstlisting}




\subsection{Subsets}

A subset of the tests can be run by utilizing the \code{run\_tests.sh} script directly.
If an argument is provided, only the tests matching it will be run.

\begin{lstlisting}[title=Ex. Run all tests matching reduce]
./run_tests.sh reduce
\end{lstlisting}
